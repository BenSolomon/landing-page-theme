          I am a graduate student in the <a href="http://mstp.wustl.edu/Pages/index.aspx">
            Medical Scientist Training Program</a> at Washington Unviersity. As a member of the lab of 
            <a href="http://www.rheumatology.wustl.edu/faculty/research-faculty/chsieh.html">Dr. Chyi-Song Hsieh</a>,
            my graduate work has focused on elucidating the interactions between the immune system and the beneficial
            commensal bacteria of the gut. More broadly, I am interested in the use of publically available data to address
            unanswered immunological questions.
